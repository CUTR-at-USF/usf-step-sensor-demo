            This sample demonstrates the use of the USF step counter sensor.
            \n\n It shows how to register a SensorEventListener for the USF sensor.
            \n\n The step counter returns the total number of steps since a listener was first
            registered for this sensor. The sensor only count steps while a listener is registered.
            This sample only covers the basic case, where a listener is only registered while the
            app is running.
